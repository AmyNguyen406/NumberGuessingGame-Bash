# NumberGuessingGame-Bash
This is a number guessing game written in Bash. 
The program starts by asking for a username. It then randomly generates a number between 0 and 128 and keeps asking the user to guess the number until the user guesses it correctly. 

If the user guesses a low number it says "low guess" and if the guess is high it says "high guess". 
The program keeps track of the number of guesses and saves the user's username and the number of guesses to a file. 
At the end of the game the top 3 scores are displayed.
